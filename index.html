                            This is not your ordinary cricket blog. This is a cricket blog that aims to cover as much of the great game as possible, with content such as previews, predictions, player ratings and opinions put forward, with no hesitation as it is something I love to do. Even though I also work full time, there is always time for cricket, and CricBlog is my way of putting my views out there and connecting with so many great cricket fans and people all over the world.

                        Football Blog aims to provide you with cutting edge analysis and opinion across the top European leagues, while also separating the fake news from the real stories.

                        This isn’t your average football blog. Rather than regurgitate rumours like the vast majority of sites, we cover a variety of topics – tactics, player profiles, predictions, match previews, in addition to deconstructing topical issues.

The Web will act as not only your personal coach, but as your statistician and commentator as well.
